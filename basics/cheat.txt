WHERE clause can be used to filter text data. However, so far you've only been able to filter by specifying the exact text you're interested in.
LIKE operator can be used in a WHERE clause to search for a pattern in a column.
You can also use the NOT LIKE operator to find records that don't match the pattern you specify.
