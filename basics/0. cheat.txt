WHERE clause can be used to filter text data. However, so far you've only been able to filter by specifying the exact text you're interested in.
LIKE operator can be used in a WHERE clause to search for a pattern in a column.
You can also use the NOT LIKE operator to find records that don't match the pattern you specify.

Aliasing simply means you assign a temporary name to something. To alias, you use the AS keyword.

ORDER BY keyword is used to sort results in ascending or descending order according to the values of one or more columns.
By default ORDER BY will sort in ascending order. If you want to sort the results in descending order, you can use the DESC keyword.

ORDER BY can also be used to sort on multiple columns. It will sort by the first column specified, then sort by the next, then the next, and so on

A word of warning: SQL will return an error if you try to SELECT a field that is not in your GROUP BY clause without using it to calculate some kind of value about the entire group.

Note that you can combine GROUP BY with ORDER BY to group your results, calculate something about them, and then order your results.
